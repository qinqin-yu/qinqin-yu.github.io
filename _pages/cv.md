Advisors: Erta Kalanxhi and Jessica Craig

Literature review, drafting, and editing for the WHO Reports on National Actiona Plans for Antimicrobial Resistance in Kenya, Malawi, and Mali

**University of California Berkeley**, Spring 2017

As a graduate rotation student, I built a laser-based autofocus system for a new stroboscopic scattering microscope. The autofocusing setup allowed observations on the microscope to be made on both short and long timescales and the setup was used for studying exciton migration in novel materials.

Advisor: Naomi Ginsberg

**Massachusetts Institute of Technology**, 2013-2015

For my undergraduate thesis with, I wrote simulations to characterize atomic trajectories in a two-color (i.e. dual-wavelength) magneto-optical trap. The two-color scheme allowed us to cool and trap atoms at lower magnetic field strengths, and this setup was incorporated into a broader experiment to create a spin-squeezed atomic clock. I also designed and implemented a laser frequency stabilization setup using optical fiber cavity feedback, performed computer simulations to optimize imaging resolution, and constructed electronic control circuits.

Advisors: Vladan Vuletic, Boris Braverman, Akio Kawasaki, Dorian Gangloff, Alexei Bylinskii

**Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, Germany**, Summer 2014

As a summer intern through the MISTI program at MIT, I designed and implementated a stable laser setup with optical feedback.

Advisors: Simon Folling and Immanuel Bloch

**Massachusetts Institute of Technology**, 2012-2013

A major open question in astrophysics is how the elements were formed in the early universe. Working with Dr. Anna Frebel, I collected spectroscopic data of old stars using the Magellan Telescopes in Chile and analyzed the spectra using peak-fitting software to quantify elemental abundances. We discovered a star with very low abundances of the heavy elements, which helped to constrain the yields in a known process (r-process) that gives rise to these elements.

Advisor: Anna Frebel

**Institute Neel, CNRS, Grenoble, France**, Summer 2012

As a summer intern through the MISTI program at MIT, I performed measurements of properties of frustrated magnetic materials with SQUID magnetometry. 

Advisors: Carley Paulsen and Elsa Lhotel

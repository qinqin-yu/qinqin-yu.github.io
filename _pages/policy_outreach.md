I am always excited about opportunities to engage with the general public about science and the process of doing science. If you are looking for someone to speak about or write about microbial evolution, pathogen evolution, science policy, or science education, or would like to collaborate on a project on any of these topics, please do reach out!

# Science Policy

During my PhD, I was involved in the [Science Policy Group](https://sciencepolicy.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, where I organized speakers in science policy and workshops for graduate students to develop communication skills in science policy. I also had the opportunity to attend the [AAAS CASE workshop](https://www.aaas.org/programs/catalyzing-advocacy-in-science-and-engineering) to learn about the federal policymaking process and advocate for science funding to policymakers. You can read more about our experience in this [blog post](https://berkeleysciencereview.com/article/2019/07/31/bridging-the-culture-gap-between-science-and-policy).

I also had the opportunity to attend the National Science Policy Network Bootcamp and intern with the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy (now the One Health Trust), where I researched, wrote, and edited for policy briefs on national action plans on antibiotic resistance in Mali, Kenya, and Malawi.

# Science Education

Between finishing undergrad and starting my PhD, I spent a year developing Kepler Tech Lab, an affordable science education lab in Kigali, Rwanda. I developed curricula in research methods, electronics recycling, and solar energy and developed a module for students to research and develop solutions to address challenges in their community. I trained teachers, built local partnerships, and did outreach to the local community. You can read more about our project and experience in this [blog](https://keplertechlab.wordpress.com/) and in this [paper](https://sftp.asee.org/kepler-tech-lab-developing-an-affordable-skills-based-engineering-lab-course-in-rwanda).

# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in STEM

During my PhD, I was very involved in the [Society of Womxn in the Physical Sciences](https://www.swpsberkeley.com/) at UC Berkeley, an organization that promotes a welcoming and successful community of womxn in the physical sciences.
